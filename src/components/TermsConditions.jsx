        1. Purpose of Our Website
      </h2>
      <p>
        QuoteBridgeHub.com is a referral service. We connect consumers with
        licensed insurance agents or companies that may offer insurance
        products. We are <em>not</em> an insurance company, broker, or agency,
        and we do not make decisions about insurance coverage.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
        2. No Guarantee of Coverage
      </h2>
      <p>
        We do not guarantee that any insurance product will meet your needs or
        result in specific outcomes. All insurance coverage decisions are made
        solely by the licensed insurance agents or companies.
      </p>

        who can provide information about Medicare Advantage, Prescription Drug
        Plans, or other insurance options. Calling the helpline is free, but the
        services or plans you choose may have costs.
